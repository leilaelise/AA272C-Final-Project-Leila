AA 272C Final Project

All code that I wrote or edited is in the Final Project code directory. I modified the Process GNSS Script from the original downloaded from the GNSS Analysis app, so it is meant to be used with all the associated MATLAB files (but I did not edit those so I did not upload them). 

The Kalman filters are meant to be run with the spreadsheets uploaded in "KFV1" and "KFV2" directories. Each HTML file requires the respective .js file and a manual input of longitude, latitude, and speed (output from the Kalman filters) to run.
